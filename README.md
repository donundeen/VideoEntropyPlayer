# VideoEntropyPlayer
a Max/MSP system for turning change in a video feed into music

Developed for an installation/performance at VisArts in Rockville, MD in 2018, this piece tracked the level of movement in a room through a video feed, converting it into fractal-based music. The intention was that as more people entered the room, the music would increase in pace and dynamics, to the point of chaos, and then back to simpler rhythms as people left the room. 

However, ultimately so few people were at the show that the installation instead encouraged active dancing in front of the camera to trigger changes in the music.

# Features
- Implemented a patch for tracking the amount of overall “change” in a video stream, converting it into a single value.
- Dynamic scaling adapts to input range.
- Integration with external modular synth (Novation Nova), midi rack synth (vintage roland), Zoom DrumTrack drum machine
